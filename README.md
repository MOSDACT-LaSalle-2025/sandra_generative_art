Technique: Processing – Interactive generative creative coding

Concept

This piece explores the tension between control and autonomy: lines that either follow the mouse or wander randomly. Each execution is unique, showing how chaos can create unexpected beauty.

Form

800×800 px canvas, white background.

Thick transparent strokes leaving organic trails.

Colors change when pressing the mouse.

Right-click saves the work as an image.

Technique

Arrays store positions of points.

Random() + constrain() control wandering movement.

Interactivity: dragging the mouse guides the lines, colors shift dynamically.
